# Simple_Text_Editor
This is a simple text editor built in Python.

It utilizes a basic custom command-promt with the following commands:
1. create - This command takes the file name as the parameter (using a hyphon '-') and creates it.
2. open - This command takes the file name as the parameter (using a hyphon '-') and allows the user to edit it.
3. kill - This command takes the file name as the parameter (using a hyphon '-') and destroys it.
4. exit - This command exits the program.

On opening the program, the command-line asks the user for his/her name, and adds it as a prefix to any and all filenames.
Following that, the command-line will begin with '$[insert-name]:'
The text editor will be somewhat similar to Vim.
